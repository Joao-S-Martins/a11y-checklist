## The Accessibility Playground
[http://playground.accessibility.tools](http://playground.accessibility.tools). A set of educational, interactive, test cases to learn a11y practices.
- Based on JS Bin
- Additionally, snippets of code can be op
- Open source to Github soon
- i8 toolkit?
#### Speakers
- Greg Kraus, ia11y.com, @ia11y

## Bring Accessibility into the Development Lifecycle with CI
- Pre-checkin process is a good test point for linting
- post-checkin, unit & smoke tests for BDD testing
- Level Access's Access Engine
- Component & functional tests
- Linting helps

## Motivating Developers
- Time & fears/costs put a11y work on to the backburner
- Phases of a11y implementation:
	+ Technical
	+ Keyboard
	+ Screenreader
- Developer motivators:
	+ Understanding challenges
	+ Createing value
	+ Building empathy
	+ Generating excitement
	+ Setting goals
- Fix the broken windows; many small wins make the big win

## 7 Minute Accessibility Assesment
[http://goo.gl/6NvnVD](http://goo.gl/6NvnVD)
- Android accessibility scanner
- Use screenreader & check for state, role...
- Complete tasks & trigger errors
- Analyze color contrast
- Assign severity; block, annoyance, trivial, technical non-conformance

#### Speakers
- Aidan Tierney @AidanA11y

## How to Improve Your Testing (for Beginners)
- Start screen reader before opening the browser
- Using JAWS w/ keyboard only
	+ Make sure the audible ezperience matches the visual experience
	+ Start with the arrow keys, not tab key
	+ Use shortcurts and make sure links, headings, title, labels etc. match
- Remove colors to see if any information is lost
- Remove images to see if any information is lost
- Check the links for a consistent implementation of link text styling & text that have similar styling that doesn't link
- Change browser color settings (inverse them) & see if any information is lost
- Enlarge text to 200% using the browser controls & enable responsive design view to check for wrapping, lost alignment, pixilation, & repositioning
- Return the screen to normal & activate a [color contrast checker](http://www.ssbbartgroup.com/reference/)
- Check that tooltip-ish dialogs either don't obscure the content behind them or can be removed by keystroke
- Remove CSS & make sure the content is still clearly represented; rarely done by the disabled, but is very telling of how other tools & search engines will view your page
- Use [Visual ARIA Bookmarklet](http://whatsock.com/training/matrices/visual-aria.htm) if you have any ARIA attributes on your page to make sure it has been implemented correctly
- Run automated web accessibility tests; Level Access [has tools](http://www.webaccessibility.com) & new toolbars are coming soon & will be announced
- Verify automatics in AMP, verify guided automatics, add manual violations

## Accessibility, Visual Design, & Front-End Development
Color contrast & keyboard access remain to be tough problems for designers to work through.
- Updating a heading may be acceptible as an accessible indicator for which tab/item is selected
- Challenges
	+ Contrast
		* Designer is mostly responsible
	+ Keyboard
		* Tab order
		* Focus management for in-page updates
		* Visual focus indeication
		* Keystrokes to select or activate
- `TAB` & `SHIFT+TAB`
- `ARROW` keys & `SPACE` to select
- `ENTER` || `SPACE` to activate
- Tooltip onFocus is kinda nice; treating onFocus the same as onHover is usually a good idea
- (See image example of who is responsible for what)
- Mobile-first design often solves your tab order
- Don't supress the browser focus indicators with a CSS reset; replace it
- Use natve elements or put in the extra JS work for full support of custom components
#### Speakers
- Level Access

## Advanced ARIA
- ARIA describes roles, states, & properties
- Buttons take `ENTER` & `SPACE`
- Links take `ENTER`
- Best practices
	+ Opt for native elements before using ARIA
	+ Checkbox, buttons, lists
- Use the [Custom Control Accessible Development Checklist]() when creating custom widgets
- Live Regions
	+ Real-time updates
	+ status updates
	+ chat logs
	+ progress indicators
	+ Must be used sparingly because multiple instances can become very confusing
	+ [Live Region Playground](http://schne324.github.io/live-region-playground)
	+ `aria-role`, `aria-live`, `aria-atomic`, `aria-relevant`
	+ [Dragon Drop](http://www.harris-schneiderman.com/demos/dragon-drop/index.html) makes use of a live region to announce changes status & command options
- Toggle buttons
	+ Keyboard operable & toggle without changing label text
	+ role=button
	+ aria-pressed=true||false, changed on `ENTER` or `SPACE`
- Modal dialog
	+ Shift focus to the modal & return it on close
	+ Circular tabbing
	+ `ESCAPE` to close
	+ `aria-label`||`aria-labelledby`
	+ `aria-hidden` applied outside of the modal for screenreaders
- Mega menu
	+ `ENTER` opens submenu if it exists, activates button otherwise
	+ `DOWN ARROW` opens submenu
	+ `UP ARROW` can return you ot the top level
	+ Many more arrow details...
	+ `ESCAPE` closes submenu & returns focus to the parent
	+ No dual-purpose menu items because of the `ENTER` behavior
	+ `role=menubar||menuitem||menu`, `aria-haspopup=true`
	+ Use list to get a size count spoken or use `aria-setsize`
	+ Adobe has a Mega Menu exaple that uses `aria-expanded`
	+ [Example](http://mattisner.com/a11y-examples/menu/)
	+ Whether menu is horizontal or vertical doesn't matter; WCAG is very specific and should be followed even if it isn't intuitive for the sighted viewer
- Tabs
	+ `role=tablist||tab||tabpanel`, `aria-controls`, `aria-selected`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-hidden`
	+ Use lists for the screenreader count
	+ ARROW keys, because tabbing a bunch really sucks.
- Checkboxes
	+ `SPACE` or 
	+ `aria-checked`, `aria-labelledby`, `role=checkbox`
- Application
	+ Overrides assisting technology
	+ Very very very rare cases where this is appropriate
	+ There is a list of elements/roles where you should't use role=application
	+ Google docs places `role=application` on the body & does it well
	+ Date-pickers are a potential use-case
