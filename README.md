# a11y-checklist
An interactive guide to making your UI work accessible to all.

---
## Outline
### Visibility
- Use the visibility of display properties, or the hidden attribute
- Don't override too many of the browser's default behaviors
### Color
- There should be a certain amount of contrast in your color choices
### Focusability
- Everything on the page should be able to have focus
- If a control on the page isn't standard, they should have an appropriate ARIA role attached to them
### State Changes
- Statndard controls have this taken car of, but for custom controls, ARIA states provide solutions (aria-checked, aria-pressed, etc)
